# V1.2

## Simulated streaming for Chat API (non-live mode)

- Implemented simulated streaming when `isLivemode === false`, emitting SSE-style chunks for tool input/output and plain text responses. This enables a smooth demo experience without calling live providers.
- Improved tool call id generation for simulated streams to reduce collisions.

## Playground: tool integration and provider selection

- Integrated additional AI tools into the Playground UI with explicit provider selection for supported tools.
- Added provider pickers for `image` (OpenAI, FAL, Runware, Gemini) and `websearch` (DuckDuckGo, Brave, Exa, Perplexity, Firecrawl).
- Forwarded selected provider and tool parameters to the API, including image count and aspect ratio.

## Image tool UI

- Refined grid rendering to better respect desired count and aspect ratio.
- Improved loading, skeleton states, and error display for a cleaner experience.

## Prompt input (AI Elements)

- Polished PromptInput styles and interaction behavior for consistency across the app.
- Extracted and stabilized attachments handling, keyboard submit, and toolbar components.

## Developer experience and refactors

- Improved type safety and code clarity across chat routes and playground components.
- Exported `getRegistryItemFromJson` for reuse in the Playground page.
