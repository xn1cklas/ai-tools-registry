# V1.1

## AI Elements support

A couple of components are now based on [AI Elements](https://ai-sdk.dev/elements/overview) developed by [Hayden Bleasel](https://x.com/haydenbleasel) and (Ryan Haraki)[https://x.com/ryanharaki_] at [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

Changed components

- Tools without a UI default to the AI Elements [Tool Component](https://ai-sdk.dev/elements/components/tool)

## UI Components now expects ToolUIPart as prop

- UI component props now derive from ToolUIPart. This way it is easiy to identify the tool and pass all standardised data to the component

## Introduction of tool variants

- The websearch tool now support multiple variants. The UI Component stays the same, but based on the install command either one of the following web search APIs will be used by the websearch tool.
  - [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) (default)
  - [Exa](https://exa.ai/)
  - [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) (via AI SDK provider)
  - [Brave](https://search.brave.com/)

## (experimental) schemas are now in schema.ts

- The websearch tool acts as a canary to try out a new approach of saving zod schemas. Instead of colocating them within the `tool.ts` definition file, they are stored within a separate `schema.ts`

## Introduction of changelogs

- Changelogs are now documented as mardkown files within the repository.
- They may or may not be moved to actual pages on the web app
- I created a changelog entry for the initial release retrospectively
